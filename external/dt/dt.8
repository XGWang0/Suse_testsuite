.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH TYPE
test
.SH DESCRIPTION
dt is a generic data test program used to verify proper operation of peripherals, file systems, device drivers, or any data stream supported by the operating system.  In its simplest mode of operation, dt writes and then verifys its default data pattern, then displays performance statisics and other test parameters before exiting.  Since verification of data is performed, dt can be thought of as a generic diagnostic tool.

.SH WHAT IT DOES
Testing of tape devices using different block sizes to determine the best blocking factor for optimum performance and capacity. Write tapes to end of tape, to determine the total tape capacity. Read existing tapes with data comparison disabled, to determine the amount of data on the tape. Reading/writing an entire tape to ensure device drivers properly sense and handle end of tape error conditions. Write a tape and ensure it can be read on another tape drive to test drive compatibility (also referred to as transportability). Read multiple tape files to ensure file marks and end of tape are reported and handled properly by tape drivers. I/O to disks using the raw device interface, to determine the optimum performance of the controller. I/O to disk files through the file system, to determine the affect the buffer cache has on write and read performance. Reading/writing of entire disks, to ensure the media capacity and end of media error handling is properly reported by device drivers. Test memory mapped files to compare I/O performance against raw and file system I/O. Testing I/O to files on NFS mounted file systems. Writing/reading pipes & FIFO's to verify pipe operation and performance. Initiating multiple processes to test optimizations of buffer cache, device drivers, and/or intelligent controllers. Force I/O at different memory boundaries to test low level driver handling. Do loopback testing of parallel or serial lines on either the same system of different systems. Enable POSIX Asynchronous I/O to verify proper operation of this API and to determine performance gains. Specify variable record options for testing variable tape devices. On Tru64 cluster systems, distributed lock manager (DLM) options can be used to control access to shared devices or files. Also available on Tru64 UNIX is the ability to use Extended Error Information (EEI) to detect and recover from SCSI bus/device resets. Monitor slow or no I/O progress. Execute a trigger when failures occur.
.SH COMMON PROBLEMS
None.
.SH WARNINGS
dt does not perform any sanity checking of the output device specified. This means if you are running as root on Unix and you specify a raw disk device, dt will overwrite existing file systems, so please be careful!
