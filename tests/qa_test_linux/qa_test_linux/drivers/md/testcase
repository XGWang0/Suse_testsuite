Test Cases:

1. mdadm --create: Create a new array from unused devices.
1.1 Create raid0 with chunk size 32k or 64k
1.2 Create raid1 with chunk size 32k or 64k
1.3 Create raid4 with chunk size 32k or 64k
1.4 Create raid5 with chunk size 32k or 64k
1.5 Create raid6 with chunk size 32k or 64k
1.6 Create raid10 with chunk size 32k or 64k

2. mdadm --assemble: Assemble a previously created array.
2.1 Assemble raid0
2.2 Assemble raid1
2.3 Assemble raid4
2.4 Assemble raid5
2.5 Assemble raid6
2.6 Assemble raid10
2.10 Assemble array by uuid
2.11 Assemble array by name
2.12 Mark the array as read-only.

3. mdadm --build: Create or assemble an array without metadata.
3.1 Create Raid0 without metadata
3.2 Assemble Raid0 without metadata
3.3 Create Raid1 without metadata
3.4 Assemble Raid1 without metadata

4. mdadm --misc
4.1 Display details of an array. raid0,1,4,5,6,10,linear,multipath and synonyms
4.2 Examine superblock on an array componerase the MD superblock from a device.ent.
4.3 Erase the MD superblock from a device.

5. mdadm --manage : make changes to an existing array.
5.1 hotadd subsequent devices to the array
5.2 subsequent devices are re-added if there were recent members of the array
5.3 remove subsequent devices, which must not be active 
5.4 mark subsequent devices a faulty
5.5 mark device(s) to be replaced by spares.
5.6 deactivate array, releasing all resources.raid0,1,4,5,6,10,linear,multipath and synonyms
5.7 Mark array as readonly.
5.8 Mark array as readwrite

6.mdadm --grow : resize/reshape an active array 
6.1 convert the array to level 0,1,4,5,6,10,linear,multipath and synonyms
6.2 Change the active size of devices in an array.
6.3 Change the chunksize of the array
6.4 Change the number of active devices in an array.
6.5 Add listed devices as part of reshape.
6.6 Add or remove a write-intent bitmap.

7. mdadm --incremental : add/remove a device to/from an array as appropriate
7.1 Run arrays as soon as a minimal number of devices are present rather than waiting for all expected.
7.2 Don't print any information messages, just errors.
7.3 Rebuild the 'map' file that mdadm uses for tracking partial arrays.
7.4 First fail (if needed) and then remove device from any array that it is a member of

8. mdadm --monitor : Monitor one or more array for significant changes.
8.1 Address to mail alerts of failure to
8.2 Program to run when an event is detected
8.3 Report alerts via syslog
8.4 specify a different config file
8.5 Fork and continue in child, parent exits
8.6 In daemon mode write pid to specified file instead of stdout
8.7 Check for degraded arrays, then exit
8.8 Generate a TestMessage event against each array at startup
