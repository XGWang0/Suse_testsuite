qa_test_contesttest
.SH SYNOPSIS
None.
.SH TYPE
test
.SH DESCRIPTION
This program is designed to test system responsiveness by running kernel compilation under a number of different load conditions. It is designed to compare different kernels, not different machines. It uses real workloads you'd expect to find for short periods in every day machines but sustains them for the duration of a kernel compile to increase the signal to noise ratio.
