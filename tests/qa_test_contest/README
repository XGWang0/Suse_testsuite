Contest in ctcs testing framework readme.

Packages: contest, contest-ctcs-glue

This program is designed to test system responsiveness by running kernel compilation under a number of different load conditions. It is designed to compare different kernels, not different machines. It uses real workloads you'd expect to find for short periods in every day machines but sustains them for the duration of a kernel compile to increase the signal to noise ratio.

/usr/share/qa/tools/contest-run - runs the benchmark

Methodics - see README: /usr/share/qa/interbench/readme or http://members.optusnet.com.au/ckolivas/contest.

This test runs contest with no atributes and lets it runs all simulated interactive tasks over all background loads.
