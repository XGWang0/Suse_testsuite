===================================================================

WARNING: this testcase is for __interactive__ use only.
         Reason: /dev/tty is utilized for the password dialogues.
         Do not try to run it from within ctcs2: it will hang indefinitely
         and eventually fail.
         Instead, execute the following command interactively:

    $MASTERSCRIPT -s

         SKIPPING this testcase now.
