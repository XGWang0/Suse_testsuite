Before running the test, please make sure have set up wireless test environment, and have done the settings:

1) Create first D-Link wireless with WPA & WPA2 Personal security method, input the SSID name and password to wireless1_name and wireless1_pwd in nm_config.py (example: SSID named "SLEDQATEAM-DLINK" with password "aaaaaaaaaa")
2) Create second D-Link wireless with WPA & WPA2 Personal security method, input the SSID name and password to wireless2_name and wireless2_pwd in nm_config.py (example: SSID named "SLEDQATEAM_LINKSYSWLAN_TEST" with password "sledqateam")
3) Please make sure NetworkManager icon is shows on 'Panel Notification Area' as index 0, otherwise please do "killall -9 nm-applet && nm-applet$" to reload it before running the test

===Testing Machine Requires===
1) Need 2 Machines, support ssh connection without password
    * ssh-keygen to create public/private rsa key pair in machine A
    * copy public key (~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub) to machine B
    * cat ~/id_rsa.pub >>~/.ssh/authorized_keys in machine B
2) Config nm_config.py to give exactly Machines settings

===Hidden Wireless Network Test===
1) Create a D-Link wireless with Invisible Status for "Hidden wireless network" testing
2) Config nm_config.py to give exactly Hidden Wireless settings

===Secure Wireless Types Test===
1) Need a wireless with WEP 40/128-bit Key security method
2) Need a wireless with WEP 128-bit Passphrase security method
3) Need a wireless wich LEAP security method
4) Need a wireless with Daynamic WEP (802.1X) security method
5) Config nm_config.py to give exactly Wireless security methods settings

===OpenVPN Test===
1) Create certificates and keys for OpenVPN test
2) Config nm_config.py to give exactly openVPN connection settings

Notice:
Would better running NetworkManager tests on local machine because Wired Network will be restarted in some tests.
    * test_local_networkManager-run

Again:
Please make sure you have completed nm_config.py settings before running the test!

GOOD LUCK :)
