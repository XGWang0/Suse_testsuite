Thu Nov  5 09:23:24 UTC 2009 - pascal.bleser@opensuse.org

- update to 1.35:
  * fixes some parser bugs
  * fixes the shared memory allocator
  * reserved keywords are now supported in job files
  * a few fixes were made for verifying workloads
  * fixed a hang when resolving component devices of md/dm arrays
  * IO log replay fixes and additions were made
  * fixed a hang due to an incorrect mutex clock source
  * added support for wider than 32-bit pattern verifies
  * fixed a few races when using async verifier threads
  * fixed a hang with the async engine and IO depth batch settings

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jul 10 00:00:00 CEST 2009 - pascal.bleser@opensuse.org

- update to 1.31:
  * fixes completion latency numbers (they would read 0)
  * fixes an alignment bug
  * improves the speed of the mmap engine on 64-bit architectures
  * adds support for asynchronous "verify" offload threads to speed "verify" workloads

- changes from 1.29:
  * fixes and improvements for the IO limiting rate option
  * fix for submission latency numbers in some cases
  * fix for a bug in the job parser that would sometimes truncate the postfix value when multiple values were given
  * a continue_on_error option was added to allow a job to keep running if it sees non-fatal errors
  * a bug in the mmap engine with large files and 32-bit machines was fixed
  * support for fdatasync() was added with the fdatasync option
  * an iomem_align option was added for fine-grained control over IO buffer memory alignment
  * the pre_read option was fixed and no longer attempts to pre-read on IO engines that cannot seek

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jun  3 00:00:00 CEST 2009 - pascal.bleser@opensuse.org

- update to 1.27:
  * corruption of submission/completion latency logs for shared files was fixed
  * blocksizes are included in latency logs
  * a "pre_read" option was added to pre-read files into memory before starting the job
  * exec_prerun/postrun now invokes a shell
  * accuracy of disk util stats was improved
  * large files are supported with an mmap engine on 32-bit architectures
  * ETA stats were improved with better throughput reporting, and IOPS reporting was added there too
  * the man page was fixed based on lintian

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Apr 22 00:00:00 CEST 2009 - pascal.bleser@opensuse.org

- update to 1.26:
  * a crash with multiple files for a job was fixed
  * reporting of throughput was corrected, as it was sometimes off by about
    2.4%
  * IO logging is allowed for diskless engines
  * support was added for different weights for reads and writes with the
    bssplit= option
  * a crash with engines not supporting get_file_size() was fixed
  * a sample SSD performance analysis job was added
  * a problem was fixed with IO offsets sometimes being too large, causing
    early exit of failed IO verification

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Feb 10 00:00:00 CET 2009 - guru@unixtech.be

- update to 1.24:
  * UDP support to the network IO engine
  * gettimeofday() optimizations
  * fixes a bug related to crashing the parser
  * fixes various bugs in the shared memory allocator
  * fixes /tmp file leaks
  * fixes CPU mask options on large systems

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Oct 10 00:00:00 CEST 2008 - guru@unixtech.be

- update to 1.22:
  * adds support for hardware accelerated CRC-32 calculation for verification
    (on supported Intel platforms w/SSE4.2)
  * adds option priorities to get rid of manual option ordering
  * increase the range of the smalloc allocator
  * adds a ramp time option to allow job warm up before doing any measurements
  * adds support for detailing RAID/LVM component utilization
  * many little bugfixes
