  "description": "\nfio is an I/O tool meant to be used both for benchmark and stress/hardware\nverification. It has support for 4 different types of I/O engines (sync,\nmmap, libaio, posixaio), I/O priorities (for newer Linux kernels), rate I/O,\nforked or threaded jobs, and much more. It can work on block devices as\nwell as files. fio accepts job descriptions in a simple-to-understand text\nformat. Several example job files are included. fio displays all sorts of\nI/O performance information, such as completion and submission latencies\n(avg/mean/deviation), bandwidth stats, cpu and disk utilization, and more.\nAuthors:\n--------\nJens Axboe <jens.axboe@oracle.com>\n%define qadir /usr/share/qa\n%debug_package",
