Description
-----------

This package provides some basic SLEPOS tests. You can also used it from bash
as functional library so SLEPOS testing is not that painful experience. It has
been also reworked so it can be run by CTCS2 framework.

Preparations
------------

To use this package you have to have installed NLPOS 9 or SLEPOS 10/11/11SP1.
It is also expected that you have installed one or more patterns/server roles.

How to use
----------

First configure this suite in /root/qa_slepos-local_config.sh. You'll not be
allowed to use slepos_lib without that. Define there which computer is admin
server and put there list of branch servers.

Further, branch server configuration file is good idea but for special cases
it can be defined by $branchserver_internal_device (resp.
$branchserver_internal_mac) and $branchserver_location, where 'branchserver'
is name of branch server.

branchserver_internal_device - this variable defines network interface used for
                               internal network (where are terminals
                               connected).

branchserver_internal_mac - MAC address of internal network device

branchserver_location - this variables specify, which location this
                        branchserver belongs to

NOTE: If hostname contains dash, define variable with underscore instead.

If there is no internal interface defined, autodetection is tried - if there
are only two interfaces (not counting lo), the interface without default route
is selected.

For interactive use just source /root/slepos_lib.sh and function suitable for
current computer role will be available. Function with same name may have
different function for each role where it makes sense. do_branch() on branch
server does it's function directly, but called on admin server it takes branch
server name as argument and call remotely.

For scripting you can call:

/root/slepos_lib.sh <function_name> [function_parameters] ...


Contents
--------

* slepos_lib.sh
  - by default in /usr/share/qa/qa_slepos with symlink in /root
  - contains all the functions
  - provides different namespace for admin server, branch server and image
    server patterns when sourced
  - can be run as script:
    slepos_lib.sh <function> [parameters]

* qa_slepos-local_config.sh
  - deployment dependent configuration, with luck the only server you need to
    edit before running test
  - symlink to /usr/share/qa/qa_test_slepos/local_config.sh
  - this should be the only file which needs editation for some basic testing

* /usr/share/qa/qa_test_slepos
  - contains the LDAP database data, data needed for establishing branch server
    or building images
  - LDAP database is structured as tree - to follow this objects sources
    configuration of its predecessor at the end
  - image-*.sh are symlinks to template_image.sh since it differs by it's name
    only, but you still have the option to create your own definition

* slepos-run
  - this dynamically creates TCF files for branch server and image creation testing
  - you can ommit some role testing with setting NO_ADMIN, NO_IMAGE or NO_BRANCH
    variables to non-empty values

* hamsta_local_config
  - this file (if exists) is sourced after qa_slepos-local_config.sh, this
    provides easy way to set variables without editing local_config.sh
  - planned for use with HAMSTA full automation


If you didn't find the information you needed, try to look inside slepos_lib or
configuration files. It should be commented well enough so you can find your
answer there. If you haven't found what you want and you find it important,
please, just send e-mail.
