Interbench in ctcs testing framework readme.

Packages: interbench, interbench-ctcs-glue

It is designed to measure the effect of changes in Linux kernel design or system configuration changes such as cpu, I/O scheduler and filesystem changes and options.
It emulates the cpu scheduling behaviour of interactive tasks and measures their scheduling latency and jitter.

/usr/share/qa/tools/interbench-run - runs the benchmark

Methodics - see README: /usr/share/qa/qa_test_interbench/readme or http://members.optusnet.com.au/ckolivas/interbench.

This test runs interbench with no atributes and lets it runs all simulated interactive tasks over all background loads.

QADB import: Latency, '% Desired CPU' and '% Deadlines Met' for every combination are parsed to QADB.
