== Hard drive harness tool
-- Author: SÃ©bastien Pierre, XPrima Corp <sebastien@xprima.com>

_Rugg_ is a *hard drive and filesystem harness tool* that allows you to test and
benchmark drives and filesystems, by writing simple to complex scenarios that
can mimic the behaviour of real-world applications.

What makes _Rugg_ special is that it can be *easily customized to test specific
usages of the filesystem*. Initially, _Rugg_ was made to test new database server
harddrives inteded to host a Postgres database. 

Here how you ''check that 100 threads can fill up a 100Gb zone of your hard
drive without data corruption'':

>   zone 100Gb, subdivide100 | fill same binary, ensure same

Features 
========

_Rugg_ offers a number of unique features, which make it a flexible tool to help
you reproduce particular condition that you would like to exercise:

	- You write _scenarios_ using a simple shell-like language
	- You can easily express parallel and sequential processes
	- Many operations are already provided, including data generation
	- Can be easily extend thanks to its Python implementation

Thanks to its features, Rugg can be used as a versatile, easy disk and
filesystem harness test, that can ensure that your hardware and software meets
your application expectations.

Requirements
============

	- [Python](http://www.python.org) 2.4+
	- A UNIX platform (Rugg will probably not work under Windows)
	- The 'locate' utility, to easily find eligible data
	- Free space to make your tests


If you want to know more, you can have a look at the
[Rugg guide](guide.html), which will tell you how to use Rugg in
detail.
