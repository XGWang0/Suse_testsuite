<h1>qa_siege test page</h1>
<p>
This is a test page for qa_siege benchmark.
</p>
<p>
Of course, siege benchmark allows you to test any possible webpages.
It even supports HTTP POSTs.
As to have comparable benchmark results from different products, we created this test page, same for all of them.
Before we were using <a href="http://localhost">http://localhost</a>, which sometimes returns Apache welcome site, sometimes a HTTP/403, making the results incomparable.
</p>
<p>
And, yes, this page is exactly 1024 bytes long - unless someone modified it, recoded it, changed CR-&gt;CRLF, or did something similar.
</p>
<p>
If you want to know what this is all about, ask QA, vmarsik, or mmrazik.
</p>
<p>
Have a nice day.
