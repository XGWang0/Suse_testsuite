cat << EOF
This is a feature test FATE312101, written in bash and C.

You can do anything here except reboot, please just make sure
that you cleanup after yourself!!!

The test results are determined by the return value of this script:

  0	PASSED
  1	FAILED
 11	INTERNAL ERROR
 22	SKIPPED

So, since this is not a real test, we will wait for three seconds
and than mark this test as skipped.

Happy testing!
