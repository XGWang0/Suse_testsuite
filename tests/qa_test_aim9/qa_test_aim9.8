.SH DESCRIPTION
The AIM Independent Resource Benchmark exercises and times each component of a UNIX computer system, independently. The benchmark uses 58 subtests to generate absolute processing rates, in operations per second, for subsystems, I/O transfers, function calls, and UNIX system calls.

Test results can be used to compare different machines on a
test-by-test basis or to measure the success or failure of system
tuning and configuration changes on a single system. This benchmark
