$0: this test requires that you be a member of more than one group,
but running \`id -G' either failed or found just one.  If you really
are a member of at least two groups, then rerun this test with
COREUTILS_GROUPS set in your environment to the space-separated list
of group names or numbers.  E.g.,

  env COREUTILS_GROUPS='users cdrom' make check
