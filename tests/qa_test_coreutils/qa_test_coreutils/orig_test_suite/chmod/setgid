# To be compatible with chmod from other vendors,
# GNU chmod must not reset a directory's setgid bit.
# The latest POSIX draft (d5) allows either behavior.  It says:
#
#   For regular files, for each bit set in the octal number
#   corresponding to the set-user-ID-on-execution or the
#   set-group-ID-on-execution, bits shown in the following table shall
#   be set; if these bits are not set in the octal number, they are
#   cleared. For other file types, it is implementation-defined whether
#   or not requests to set or clear the set-user-ID-on-execution or
#   set-group-ID-on-execution bits are honored.

# FIXME: consider changing GNU chmod to work like other versions of chmod.
# For now, this test simply confirms the existing behavior.
