# Ensure that using `cp --preserve=link' to copy hard-linked arguments
# onto existing destinations works, even when one of the link operations fails.
# This bug was fixed in coreutils-4.5.9.
# To exercise this bug is non-trivial:
# Set-up requires at least three hard-linked files.  In copying them,
# while preserving links, the initial copy must succeed, the attempt
# to create the second file via `link' must fail, and the final `link'
# (to create the third) must succeed.  Before the corresponding fix,
# the first and third destination files would not be linked.
#
# Note that this is nominally a test of `cp', yet it is in the tests/mv
# directory, because it requires use of the --preserve=link option that
# mv enables by default.
