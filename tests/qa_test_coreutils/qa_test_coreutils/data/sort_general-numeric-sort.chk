Each region uses these lists sequentially. If the last storm of the year is Lisa, the first storm of the next year is Marcus. This is a new set of name lists used by the Bureau of Meteorology effective in 1996.

Experience shows that the use of short, distinctive given names in written as well as spoken communications is quicker and less subject to error than the older more cumbersome latitude-longitude identification methods. These advantages are especially important in exchanging detailed storm information between hundreds of widely scattered stations, coastal bases, and ships at sea.

Several names have been changed since the lists were last used. Four names from the 1995 list have been retired. On the 2001 list, Lorenzo has replaced Luis, Michelle has replaced Marilyn, Olga has replaced Opal, and Rebekah has replaced Roxanne. Three names from the 1996 list have been retired. On the 2002 list, Cristobal has replaced Cesar, Fay has replaced Fran, and Hanna has replaced Hortense. Two names from the 1998 list have been retired. On the 2004 list, Gaston has replaced Georges and Matthew has replaced Mitch. On the 2006 list, Kirk has replaced Keith. Here is more information on the retirement of hurricane names.
Since 1953, Atlantic tropical storms have been named from lists originated by the National Hurricane Center and now maintained and updated by an international committee of the World Meteorological Organization. The lists featured only women's names until 1979, when men's and women's names were alternated. Six lists are used in rotation. Thus, the 2001 list will be used again in 2007. Here is more information on the history of naming hurricanes.
Southwest Indian ocean names:
The names are used one after the other. When the bottom of one list is reached, the next name is the top of the next list.
The only time that there is a change in the list is if a storm is so deadly or costly that the future use of its name on a different storm would be inappropriate for reasons of sensitivity. If that occurs, then at an annual meeting by the WMO committee (called primarily to discuss many other issues) the offending name is stricken from the list and another name is selected to replace it.
These lists are also re-cycled every six years (the 2002 list will be used again in 2008).
These lists are used sequentially, and they are not rotated every few years as are the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific lists. The lists are maintained by the Seychelles Meteorological Service.
These names are also used sequentially. If the last storm of the year is Cimaron, the first storm of the next year is Chebi.
