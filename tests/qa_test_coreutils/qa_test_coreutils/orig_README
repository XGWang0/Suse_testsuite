The orig_test_suite directory contains the original test suite
which is shipped with the coreutils package (in the 'test' directory).

Scripts starting with 'orig_' run the various tests from this directory.
The original test suite is not modified in any way.

Following tests are not included:

* stty/basic-1

    This test must have a controlling input `terminal',
    so it may not be run via `batch', `at', or `rsh'.
    On some systems, it may not even be run in the background.
